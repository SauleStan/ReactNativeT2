Cook and stir until onions have softened but not taken on any color, about 10 or 15 minutes.\nStep 2: Cut off ends of squash. Carefully cut squash in half lengthwise and remove the seeds. Peel the squash with a vegetable peeler. Cut into chunks.\nStep 3: Raise heat under pot to medium-high. Stir in tomato paste; cook and stir until mixture begins to caramelize and turn brown, about 2 minutes. Add squash, chicken broth, 1 teaspoon salt, and cayenne pepper. Bring to a simmer; reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until squash is very tender, 15 to 25 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Blend with an immersion blender until very smooth. Stir in cream and maple syrup; add more salt if needed.\nStep 4: Ladle into serving bowls. Garnish with a swirl of cream, and a sprinkle of chives and pomegranate seeds.",
